The Node-to-Client (N2C) source uses Ouroboros mini-protocols to connect to a local Cardano node through a unix socket bearer and fetches block data using the ChainSync mini-protocol instantiated to "full blocks".

## Configuration

The following snippet shows an example of how to set up a typical N2C source:

```toml
[source]
type = "N2C"
socket_path = "<socket location>"
```

### Section `source`:

- `type`: this field must be set to the literal value `N2C`.
- `socket_path`: the location of the socket file.

## Examples

Connecting to a local Cardano node through unix sockets:

```toml
[source]
type = "N2C"
socket_path = "/opt/cardano/cnode/sockets/node0.socket"
```
