Download block object from S3 storage. 

This source requires building oura using the feature `aws` enabled.

## Configuration

The following snippet shows an example of how to set up a S3 source:

```toml
[source]
type = "S3"
bucket = "bucket-name"
items_per_batch = 10
```

the envs below need to be set if oura is not running in the aws environment configured

```sh
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

### Section `source`:

- `type`: this field must be set to the literal value `S3`
- `bucket`: bucket name
- `items_per_batch`: sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response
