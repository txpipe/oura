title: Wasm
---

The `wasm` or `webassembly` filter will allow a wasm binary to be executed as a stage within the pipeline. Therefore, it's possible to write a stage in any language that supports wasm.

## Configuration

Adding the following section to the daemon config file will enable the filter as part of the pipeline:

```toml
[[filters]]
type = "WasmPlugin"
path = "./extract_fee/plugin.wasm"
```

Follow this example to build a plugin wasm in golang [example](https://github.com/txpipe/oura/blob/main/examples/wasm_basic/README.md)
