The `select` filter makes it possible to filter data that make sense for your cases. 

The select filter requires [ParseCbor](/oura/v2/filters/parse_cbor) filter enabled to work.

## Configuration

Adding the following section to the daemon config file will enable the filter as part of the pipeline:

```toml
[[filters]]
type = "Select"
skip_uncertain = true
predicate = <match>
```

## Examples

Match any tx that interacts with this particular address

```toml
predicate = "addr1qx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgse35a3x"
```

Match any tx that interacts with this particular stake address

```toml
predicate = "stake178phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcccycj5"
```

Match any tx that interacts with this particular asset

```toml
predicate = "asset17jd78wukhtrnmjh3fngzasxm8rck0l2r4hhyyt"
```

Match any tx that holds a particular datum

```toml
predicate = "datum1httkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3j"
```

Match any tx that holds a particular metadata label

```toml
predicate = "#127"
```

Match any tx that interacts with any of these particular address

```toml
[filters.predicate]
any = [
    "addr1qx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgse35a3x",
    "addr1w8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcyjy7wx",
    "addr1vx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzers66hrl8",
]
```

Match any tx that interacts with all of these particular address simultaneously

```toml
[filters.predicate]
all = [
    "addr1w8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcyjy7wx",
    "stake178phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcccycj5",
]
```

Match any tx that simultanously interacts with a particlar address, holds a particular asset and present a particular metadata label

```toml
[filters.predicate]
all = [
    "addr1w8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcyjy7wx",
    "asset17jd78wukhtrnmjh3fngzasxm8rck0l2r4hhyyt",
    "#789",
]
```

Match tx that has an output that simultaneously points to a particular address and contains a particular asset

```toml
[filters.predicate.match.output]
address = "addr1w8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcyjy7wx"
assets = ["asset17jd78wukhtrnmjh3fngzasxm8rck0l2r4hhyyt"]
datum = "datum1httkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3j"
```

## Metadata Filtering

Match any tx that holds a particular metadata label

```toml
predicate = "#674"
```

Match transactions with metadata containing regex pattern (recursively searches arrays and maps)

```toml
[filters.predicate.match.metadata]
label = 674

[filters.predicate.match.metadata.value.text]
regex = "(?i)hello.*world"  # Case-insensitive
```
