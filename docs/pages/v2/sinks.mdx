# Sinks

Sinks are the "destination" of the events processed by _Oura_. They are the concrete link between the internal representation of the data records and the corresponding external service interested in the data. Typical sinks include: database engines, stream-processing engines, web API calls and FaaS solutions.

## Built-in Sinks

These are the existing sinks that are included as part the main _Oura_ codebase:

- [Terminal](sinks/terminal): a sink that outputs events into stdout with fancy coloring.
- [Kakfa](sinks/kafka): a sink that sends each event into a Kafka topic.
- [Elasticsearch](sinks/elastic): a sink that writes events into an Elasticsearch index or data stream.
- [Webhook](sinks/webhook): a sink that outputs each event as an HTTP call to a remote endpoint.
- [File Rotate](sinks/file_rotate): a sink that saves events to the file system using JSONL text files.
- [AWS SQS](sinks/aws_sqs): a sink that sends each event as message to an AWS SQS queue.
- [AWS Lamda](sinks/aws_lambda): a sink that invokes an AWS Lambda function for each event.
- [AWS S3](sinks/aws_s3): a sink that saves the CBOR content of the blocks as an AWS S3 object.
- [Redis Streams](sinks/redis_streams): a sink that sends each event into a Redis stream.
- [RabbitMQ](sinks/rabbitmq): a sink that sends each event into a RabbitMQ exchange.
- [GCP Cloudfunction](sinks/gcp_cloudfunction): a sink that sends each event into a Cloudfunction.
- [GCP Pubsub](sinks/gcp_pubsub): a sink that sends each event into a Pubsub topic.
- [Stdout](sinks/stdout): a sink that outputs events into stdout.

New sinks are being developed, information will be added in this documentation to reflect the updated list. Contributions and feature request are welcome in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/txpipe/oura).
