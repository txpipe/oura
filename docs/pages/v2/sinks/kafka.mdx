# Kafka

A sink that implements a _Kafka_ producer. Each event is json-encoded and sent as a message to a single Kafka topic.

## Configuration

```toml
[sink]
type = "Kafka"
brokers = ["kafka-broker-0:9092"]
topic = "cardano-events"
```

- `type`: the literal value `Kafka`.
- `brokers`: indicates the location of the _Kafka_ brokers within the network. Several hostname:port pairs can be added to the array for a "cluster" scenario.
- `topic` this field indicates which _Kafka_ topic to use to send the outbound messages.
