# Intersect Options

Advanced options for instructing Oura from which point in the chain to start reading from.

## Feature

When running in daemon mode, Oura provides 4 different strategies for finding the intersection point within the chain sync process.

- `Tip`: Oura will start reading from the current tip of the chain.
- `Origin`: Oura will start reading from the beginning of the chain.
- `Point`: Oura will start reading from a particular point [slot, hash] in the chain.
- `Breadcrumbs`: Oura will start reading from a some points [[slot, hash],[slot, hash]] in the chain.

The default strategy use by Oura is `Tip`, unless an alternative option is specified via configuration.

You can also define a finalizing point by providing a block hash at which oura will stop reading from the the chain and exit gracefully.

## Configuration

To modify the default behaviour used by the daemon mode, a section named `[intersect]` needs to be added in the `daemon.toml` file.

```toml
[intersect]
type = <Type>
value = <Value>
```

- `type`: Defines which strategy to use. Valid values are `Origin`, `Tip`, `Point`, `Breadcrumbs`. Default value is `Tip`.
- `value`: Either a point or an array of points to be used as argument for the selected strategy.

## Examples

The following example show how to configure Oura to use a intersection point.

```toml
[intersect]
type = "Point"
value = [
    4493860,
    "ce7f821d2140419fea1a7900cf71b0c0a0e94afbb1f814a6717cff071c3b6afc",
]
```
