Advanced options for instructing Oura how to deal with failed attempts.

## Configuration

To modify the default behavior, a section named `[retries]` needs to be added to the `daemon.toml` file.

```toml
[retries]
max_retries = 3
backoff_unit_sec = 10
backoff_factor = 3
max_backoff_sec = 10
dismissible = true
```

- `max_retries`: the max number of retries before failing the whole pipeline.
- `backoff_unit_sec`: the delay expressed in seconds between each retry.
- `backoff_factor`: the amount to increase the backoff delay after each attempt.
- `max_backoff_sec`: the longest possible delay in seconds.
- `dismissible`:
