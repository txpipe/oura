# Finalize Options

Advanced options for instructing Oura to stop on a chain point. If you'd like it to only sync a specific section of the chain, you can also instruct oura to stop syncing when it reaches a specific block hash by defining a `[finalize]` config.

## Configuration

To modify the default behavior the daemon mode uses, a section named `[finalize]` needs to be added to the `daemon.toml` file.

```toml
[finalize]
until_hash = <BlockHash>
max_block_slot = <SlotNumber>
```

## Examples

The following example show how to configure Oura to stop sync on Byron era

```toml
[finalize]
until_hash = "aa83acbf5904c0edfe4d79b3689d3d00fcfc553cf360fd2229b98d464c28e9de"
```
