# Deno filter

The `deno` filter will allow JS code to be implemented as a stage within the pipeline.

Therefore it will be possible to manipulate the block data dynamically and according to the specific rules of your business.

## Configuration

Adding the following section to the daemon config file will enable the filter as part of the pipeline:

```toml
[[filters]]
type = "Deno"
main_module = "JS file Path"
use_async = true
```

The file should export a function that takes the event data as a parameter, for example

```js
export async function mapEvent(event) {
    const event2 = { ...event, extraProp: "123abc" };
    return event2;
}
```
