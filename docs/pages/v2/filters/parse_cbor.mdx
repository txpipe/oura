# Parse CBOR filter

The `parse_cbor` filter aims to map cbor transactions to a structured transaction.

However, the filter will only work when the record received in the stage is CborTx in other words a transaction in Cbor format that was previously extracted from a block by another stage, otherwise, parse_cbor will ignore and pass the record to the next stage. When the record is CborTx, parse_cbor will decode and map the Cbor to a structure, so the next stage will receive the ParsedTx record. If no filter is enabled, the stages will receive the record in CborBlock format, and if only the parse_cbor filter is enabled in `daemon.toml`, it will be necessary to enable the [split_cbor](split_block) filter for the stage to receive the CborTx format.

## Configuration

Adding the following section to the daemon config file will enable the filter as part of the pipeline:

```toml
[[filters]]
type = "ParseCbor"
```

## Examples

Below is an example of the data that will be sent to the sink. A block can contain many transactions, so the sink will receive an event for each transaction in json format.

```json
{
  "event": "apply",
  "point": {
    "slot": 0,
    "hash": ""
  },
  "record": {
    "inputs": [],
    "outputs": [],
    ...
  }
}
```
