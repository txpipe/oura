# Parse CBOR filter

The `parse_cbor` filter aims to map cbor blocks to structured blocks and cbor transactions to structured transactions.

- When the record received in the stage is CborBlock, the filter will decode and map it to ParsedBlock, which is passed to the next stage.
- When the record received in the stage is CborTx, the filter will decode and map it to ParsedTx, which is passed to the next stage. This will only happen when the record received in the stage is CborTx and therefore requires to enable the [split_cbor](split_block) filter before for the stage to receive the CborTx format.
- Else, parse_cbor will ignore and pass the record to the next stage.

## Configuration

Adding the following section to the daemon config file will enable the filter as part of the pipeline:

```toml
[[filters]]
type = "ParseCbor"
```

## Examples

Below is an example of the data that will be sent to the sink when the filter received a CborBlock record.

```json
{
  "event": "apply",
  "point": {
    "slot": 0,
    "hash": ""
  },
  "record": {
    "header": {},
    "body": {}
  }
}
```

Below is an example of the data that will be sent to the sink when the filter received a CborTx record. A block can contain many transactions, so the sink will receive an event for each transaction.

```json
{
  "event": "apply",
  "point": {
    "slot": 0,
    "hash": ""
  },
  "record": {
    "inputs": [],
    "outputs": [],
    ...
  }
}
```
