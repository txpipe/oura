# Split CBOR Block filter

The `split_block` filter will decode the Cbor block and map each transaction within the block to the CborTx format.

Therefore the next stage will receive each transaction that was in the block as an event in the pipeline, i.e. if the block contains 5 transactions the next stage will receive 5 events with each transaction, in CborTx format.

## Configuration

Adding the following section to the daemon config file will enable the filter as part of the pipeline:

```toml
[[filters]]
type = "SplitBlock"
```

## Examples

Below is an example of the data that will be sent to the sink. A block can contain many transactions, so the sink will receive an event for each transaction.

```json
{
  "event": "apply",
  "point": {
    "slot": 0,
    "hash": ""
  },
  "record": {
    "hex": ""
  }
}
```
