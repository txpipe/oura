# Sources

Sources represent the "origin" of the events processed by _Oura_. Any compatible source is responsible for feeding blockchain data into _Oura's_ pipeline for further processing.

## Built-in Sources

These are the currently available sources included as part the main _Oura_ codebase:

- [N2N](sources/n2n.mdx): an Ouroboros agent that connects to a Cardano node using node-2-node protocols.
- [N2C](sources/n2c.mdx): an Ouroboros agent that connects to a Cardano node using node-2-client protocols.
- [UtxoRPC](sources/utxorpc.mdx): a source uses gRPC to fetch blocks and receive blocks from a no Dolos.

New source are being developed, information will be added in this documentation to reflect the updated list. Contributions and feature request are welcome in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/txpipe/oura).
