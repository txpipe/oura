# Introduction

## Motivation

We have tools to "explore" the Cardano blockchain, which are useful when you know what you're looking for. We argue that there's a different, complementary use-case which is to "observe" the blockchain and react to particular event patterns.

_Oura_ is a rust-native implementation of a pipeline that connects to the tip of a Cardano node through a combination of _Ouroboros_ mini-protocol (using either a unix socket or tcp bearer), filters the events that match a particular pattern and then submits a succinct, self-contained payload to pluggable observers called "sinks".

## Etymology

The name of the tool is inspired by the `tail` command available in unix-like systems which is used to display the tail end of a text file or piped data. Cardano's consensus protocol name, _Ouroboros_, is a reference to the ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, which means "tail eating". "Oura" is the ancient greek word for "tail".

## Under the Hood

All the heavy lifting required to communicate with the Cardano node is done by the [Pallas](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas) library, which provides an implementation of the Ouroboros multiplexer and a few of the required mini-protocol state-machines (ChainSync and LocalState in particular).

The data pipeline makes heavy use (maybe a bit too much) of multi-threading and mpsc channels provided by Rust's `std::sync` library.

## Use Cases

### CLI to Watch Live Transactions

You can run `oura watch <socket>` to print TX data into the terminal from the tip of a local or remote node. It can be useful as a debugging tool for developers or if you're just curious to see what's going on in the network (for example, to see airdrops as they happen or oracles posting new information).

### As a Bridge to Other Persistence Mechanisms

Similar to the well-known db-sync tool provided by IOHK, _Oura_ can be used as a daemon to follow a node and output the data into a different data storage technology more suited for your final use-case. The main difference with db-sync is that _Oura_ was designed for easy integration with data-streaming pipelines instead of relational databases.

Given its small memory / cpu footprint, _Oura_ can be deployed side-by-side with your Cardano node even in resource-constrained environments, such as Raspberry PIs.

### As a Trigger of Custom Actions

_Oura_ running in `daemon` mode can be configured to use custom filters to pinpoint particular transaction patterns and trigger actions whenever it finds a match. For example: send an email when a particular policy / asset combination appears in a transaction; call an AWS Lambda function when a wallet delegates to a particular pool; send a http-call to a webhook each time a metadata key appears in the TX payload;

### As a Library for Custom Scenarios

If the available out-of-the-box features don't satisfy your particular use-case, _Oura_ can be used a library in your Rust project to set up tailor-made pipelines. Each component (sources, filters, sinks, etc) in _Oura_ aims at being self-contained and reusable. For example, custom filters and sinks can be built while reusing the existing sources.

## (Experimental) Windows Support
_Oura_ Windows support is currently __experimental__, Windows build supports only [Node-to-Node](./sources/n2n) source with tcp socket bearer.
