# Usage

_Oura_ provides three different execution modes:

- [Daemon](usage/daemon.md): a fully-configurable pipeline that runs in the background. Sources, filters and sinks can be combined to fulfil particular use-cases.
- [Watch](usage/watch.md): to watch live block events from a node directly in the terminal. It is meant for humans, it uses colors and throttling to facilitate reading.
- [Dump](usage/dump.md): to dump live block events from a node into rotation log files or stdout. It uses JSONL format for persistence of the events.
