# Sources

Sources represent the "origin" of the events processed by _Oura_. Any compatible source is responsible for feeding blockchain data into _Oura's_ pipeline for further processing.

## Built-in Sources

These are the currently available sources included as part the main _Oura_ codebase:

- [N2N](n2n.md): an Ouroboros agent that connects to a Cardano node using node-2-node protocols
- [N2C](n2c.md): an Ouroboros agent that connects to a Cardano node using node-2-client protocols

New source are being developed, information will be added in this documentation to reflect the updated list. Contributions and feature request are welcome in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/txpipe/oura).
