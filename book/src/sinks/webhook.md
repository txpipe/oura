# Webhook

A sink that outputs each event as an HTTP call to a remote endpoint. Each event is json-encoded and sent as the body of a request using `POST` method.

The sink expect a 200 reponse code for each HTTP call. If found, the process will continue with the next message. If an error occurs (either at the tcp or http level), the sink will apply the corresponding retry logic as specified in the configuration.

## Configuration

```toml
[sink]
type = "Webhook"
url = "https://endpoint:5000/events"
authorization = "user:pass"
timeout = 30000
error_policy = "Continue"

[sink.retry_policy]
max_retries = 30
backoff_unit =  5000
backoff_factor = 2
max_backoff = 100000

[sink.headers]
extra_header_1 = "abc"
extra_header_2 = "123"
```
