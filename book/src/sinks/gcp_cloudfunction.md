# Google Cloud Functions

A sink that sends each event to a cloud function. Each event is json-encoded and sent as a POST request.

## Configuration

```toml
[sink]
type = "GcpCloudFunction"
url = "https://REGION-PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/FUNCTION_NAME"
timeout = 30000
error_policy = "Continue"
authorization = true

[sink.headers]
extra_header_1 = "abc"
extra_header_2 = "123"

[sink.retry_policy]
max_retries = 30
backoff_unit =  5000
backoff_factor = 2
max_backoff = 100000
```
