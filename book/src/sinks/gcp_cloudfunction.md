# Google Cloud Functions

A sink that sends each event to a cloud function. Each event is json-encoded and sent as a POST request.

## Configuration

```toml
[sink]
type = "GcpCloudFunction"
url = "https://REGION-PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/FUNCTION_NAME"
timeout = 30000
authorization = true

[sink.headers]
extra_header_1 = "abc"
extra_header_2 = "123"
```

### Section: `sink`

- `type`: the literal value `GcpCloudFunction`
- `url`: Your function url
- `timeout` (optional): the timeout value for the HTTP response in milliseconds. Default value is `30000`.
- `authorization` (optional): value to add as the 'Authorization' HTTP header
- `headers` (optional): key-value map of extra headers to pass in each HTTP call
